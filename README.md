# UnityTools

This is a repository dedicated to tools for unity either personally written by me or scoured on the internet. 
Will be updated regularly. 

1. Editor/Tools/PerspectiveMove.cs - Editor extension that allows you to use CTRL+SHIFT+ARROWKEYS to move objects in the scene view.
The script understands perspective and will move objects relative to the camera view, so CTRL+SHIFT+UP will always move the selection
forward relative to your view. 

2. SubvectorExtensions.cs - Simple extension-method boilerplate that isolates components of a Vector3.

3. QuaternionExtensions.cs - Simple Quaternion clamping functionality.
